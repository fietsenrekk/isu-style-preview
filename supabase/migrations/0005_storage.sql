-- UCHI 0005: storage bucket 'gallery' and its storage.objects policies.
-- Contract: public read (served by the public object URL, which needs no policy),
-- 10 MB, four image types; writes only for admins; no anon SELECT/list policy.
--
-- One addition to the contract: an admin-only SELECT policy. Supabase Storage needs
-- SELECT alongside UPDATE for upsert/overwrite, and the admin page needs to list
-- what is in the bucket. Anonymous visitors still have no SELECT/list policy.
